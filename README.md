#Project.py contains our original CNN model, resnet_test.py contains the ResNet model that we ended up using and projecttest.py is our test file which writes the predictions to a csv file. 
Project.py and resnet_test.py will both begin to train when run, and save their checkpoint to a .pt file. Projecttest.py should analyze the test data and save the results to a .csv file when run.
It will print the first 20 predictions on the command line.
